# SimpleCalc
Just a little Python Calculator I wrote after learning the basics of this language.

A few days after I coded and tested it I noticed, that there is no feature implemented that would stop users from dividing by zero. 
But I guess I won't bother with this anymore. Just keep it in mind, if you are new to programming like me and use it as some kind of
template :)
